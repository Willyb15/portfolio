## Building a Portfolio Website with HTML, CSS, jQuery
###This is me saving copy to the inter-web
####Using Bootstrap made an outline and shitty inverted BootStrap NavBar
####Using sass to compile css into scss
####Implemented sweet page-load sequence using CSS animations
#####Wrote JavaScript so after load sequence page starts or "scrolls" at the tippy top
####Converted awesome youtube video to a .webm file and embedded HTML
